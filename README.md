# Module-20


I renamed the project to Credit-Risk-Classification. This work is about creating a machine learning model to guess loan risks well. It helps banks figure out if lending money is safe or risky, aiming to lower the chance of losing money and better lending strategies.

We looked at loan data to predict risk. We noted the data details, like the counts of different risk levels. The steps in our machine learning work included preparing data, choosing a model like LogisticRegression, and checking the model's accuracy with metrics.

Our model is good at predicting safe and risky loans, especially after improving the data balance. It's very accurate and helpful for banks to decide on loans. I suggest using this improved model for future credit risk checks. It's accurate and reliable for identifying if loans are safe or might not be paid back.
